## bitcoin done right

The simplest and most secure bitcoin wallet on any platform

![screenshot1](/images/screenshot1.jpg)

### The first standalone iOS bitcoin wallet:

Unlike other iOS bitcoin wallets, **breadwallet** is a real standalone bitcoin client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access your money. Using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, **breadwallet** connects directly to the bitcoin network with the fast performance you need on a mobile device.

### The next step in wallet security:

**breadwallet** is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes, *even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, keychain and code signatures, breadwallet represents a significant security advance over web and desktop wallets, and other mobile platforms.

### Beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is **breadwallet**'s core design principle. A simple backup phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or broken.  Because **breadwallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.

### Translations managed by:

[PhraseApp - Start localizing software the simple way](https://phraseapp.com)

### URL scheme:

**breadwallet** supports the [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com) specification with the following URLs:

```
komodowallet://x-callback-url/address?x-success=myscheme://myaction
```

This will callback with the current wallet receive address: `myscheme://myaction?address=1XXXX`

The following will ask the user to authorize copying a list of their wallet addresses to the clipboard before calling back:

```
komodowallet://x-callback-url/addresslist?x-success=myscheme://myaction
```

### WARNING:

***Installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged.***

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its .entitlements file.
